# sfguide-end-to-end-analytics-with-snowflake-and-power-bi

## Overview
In this guide we will learn how to easily transform raw data into an optimal format for analysis within Power BI. This quickstart will build upon the [An Introduction to Tasty Bytes](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/tasty_bytes_introduction/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) quickstart. We'll begin by profiling the data within Snowsight, followed by creating new roles and granting appropriate privileges for our fictitious global BI Analyst team. Next, we'll enrich our data with third party location data from the Snowflake Marketplace in a matter of minutes. From there, we'll transform our raw data into an optimal model for downstream analysis within Power BI. Next, we'll add column and row-level data protections to our data model. Lastly, we'll connect the provided Power BI template (.pbit) file to our Snowflake data model and analyze sales transactions live.
